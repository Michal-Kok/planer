# Enjoy my „Planer” project.

It is simple ‘to do list’ written in React.js. All animations were created with GSAP. This app uses Local Storage as database. Simply but very effective. It is also safe until someone open it(or remove accidentally). This is app created only for desktops so RWD doesn't exist here.
